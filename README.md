## Important Rules :link:

1. If you are stuck on the same question for more than **10** minutes during the lecture, ask for **HELP DESK** immediately (always read the entire question then ask us), and work on the other question till a **TA** help you.
2. If you are stuck on the same question more than 2 times during the lecture time, you should skip it and go to the next one (and come back to it after trying and going through all the questions).
3. If you are stuck on the same question for more than 20-30 minutes outside the lecture time, you should ask us on `#C10_student-technical-questions`.
4. You cannot use Google, or ChatGPT, or search for any hint or answers, except if there is a hint in the question itself (which will explain to you what exactly you need to search or read about it).
5. Cheating is not allowed, you are cheating if you copy more than **1** line from the internet or any place, and you can't explain it and can't explain it **100%** when we ask you.
6. Don't leave the **Zoom Meeting** while you are on a break (just mute your microphone and turn off your camera) and when you come back click on **Yes**, so we know that you returned.
7. You need to work on yourself a lot, you should study **14-28** hours at least per week (to review the material, solve problems, do homework, and do projects).
8. You are not allowed to leave the **Zoom Meeting** before the end of the session.
9. You are not allowed to send a message to any staff members. If you have any `non-technical` questions send a message to the `Class Coordinator` on Slack and If you have a `technical` question, not during your session time, write a post in `#C10_student-technical-questions` channel, and you will receive an answer in **48 hours**.
